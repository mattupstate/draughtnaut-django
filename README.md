# DraughtNaut

DraughtNaut is a hypothetical website concept I use to learn new languages and frameworks. In this case, Python and Django

To run the application, rename the folder you cloned the repository into to 'draughtnaut' and form the command line run:

    python manage.py runserver

You must have Django, and South installed for this application to run properly. To install Django visit the [Django website](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/).

To install South use easy_install:

    sudo easy_install South
